 has been deducted. this was totally unforeseen by me. luckily there was sufficient funds maintained in that account else the cheque would have been dishonored and my reputation put at stake. i didn't expect such kind of goof up by a reputed firm like yours.

 we have closed the said loan account by paying all the necessary amount. 
 
today we have received the message of instalment which is due on 99'th of may. you are requested to hold the installment,

 dear sir, 
 
 
 you are aware of our bt/topup loan sanctioned by aditya birla housing finance ltd @ 99%. though, it is not possible for you to revise
 
 
 the present loan roi from 99% to 99%, your pune office head, mr. manish mishra, has verbally agreed to reduce the roi at 99.99% which
 
 
 we have accepted.also valuation has been done for topup. after repeated followup, mr. manish has not given us official confirmation of the
 
 
 same. till we get the official confirmation we cannot cancel the loan sanctioned by aditya birla.
 
 
 
 
 you are therefore requested to give us a official confirmation of reduced roi and topup, so that we can proceed further for cancellation 
 of our sanctioned loan of aditya birla, as they are in continuous followup to completed the balance formalities which we have kept on 
 hold.

11800,REQUEST,FORECLOSURE,Close,2016-06-07 08:50:00,"dear concerned @ edelweiss

we have a loan account number loannumber .

the loan was approved for rs 9,99,99,999 and we were asked to move ahead
with property purchase, on the date of registry we were shocked to hear
that there is a discrepancy in our partnership deed (deed not registered)
and the cheques cannot be handed over, now you can understand the
embrassement caused as we had already paid a heavy amount to the seller,
the seller threntned us to forfiet the amount paid to him if he does not
get edelwiss cheque.

why was the deed not checked earlier as the photocopy was already provided
to you, we could have cancelled the deal and would not have paid advance
to the seller 

the disbursement documents were got signed by us without sanction letter
by your executive atul singh with verbal discussion on roi, tenure,
amount, foreclosure etc. we were informed that there is a lock in of 9
months, 9% charges if loan closed in a year and nil thereafter. we got the
sanction letter with a clause of 9% charges prepayment we were told that
these are standard terms of the letter and we will get another letter with
the revised prepayment charges, as per atul he had taken necessary
approvals for the same and also handed over the revised letter to us but
we are unable to trace it.

if the approvals are in place which you can check in your mails, why is it
not updated in records and the closure letter that we have received has a
charges of rs 9,99,999 

we were asked to give some additional collateral if we want the entire
amount to be disbursed, we gave original property papers of a 99, new
krishna park, vikaspuri, a 999 sq yd basement, but the amount that we got
was only 99 lacs, rest of the amount was holded back and was never paid to
us,

why was that amount not paid to us when confirmed if amount not paid to
us why were we charged emi on the entire amount for 9 months excess
payment charged for rs 9,99,999 which should be refunded back to us.

9% processing fees charged on the entire amount 9 cr whereas the amount
paid was only 99 lacs, we were told that the fees will be refunded, we got
the refund of rs 99999 on 99 july, why not rs 99999 

the loan was corrected on 99 july, you cancelled your cheques of 99 lacs
which were in your possession and reduced the loan amount without taking
our consent on reduction on tenure or principle and we were forced to pay
higher emi on less amount.

and after all this happened when we want to close the loan we got a letter
that we have to pay charges on the so called amount which was never paid
to us, we have tolerated enough and now we have lost our patience.

need immediate attention and solution or else we would be forced to go to
banking ombudsman in this regard.

amount of rs. 9,99,999/- towards insurance premium for insuring our md mr. sandeep

sanction of the said lap loan. however after the recent meeting with your mr,

 since this insurance is optional
we want to inform you that we not want to avail the option of insurance.

premium from the proceeds of the loan may please be paid/refunded to

 as system is not allowing to change, unable to reduce the hl roi then again he informed yesterday that top up loan also unable to change as inter linked with hl.
 
 
 this is really not acceptable, if i paid part payment, system will accept but for my request alone system wont accept right .

 hello uttamkumar, 
 
 
 
 
 
 this in reference to the mortgage loan against the property. i believe that there had been few discrepancies related to my lap account. i am sending this mail to bring about those issues
 in to your notice as discussed in our telephonic conversation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 below are the details for the account: 
 
 
 
 
 name:- ruchik u joshi 
 loan no:- loannumber 
 
 
 
 
 
 there are mainly three issues which i feel should be resolved at the first place before even the loan disbursement phase. below are the prime issues which i want to be resolved soonest
 the possible, 
 
 
 
 
 pre emi before the actual loan disbursement 
 wrongly consideration of ruchik u joshi as a huf 
 lod(list of documents) not received 
 
 
 
 
 
 here coming to the first issue as per the welcome letter from ehfl, the loan was to be disbursed on 99th feb -9999. whereas i have received
 rs 99,99,999/- on 9-9-9999, and rs 99,99,999/- on 99-9-9999. then how come i was required to pay a pre emi of rs 99,999/- on 9-9-99 checkout the scan copy in the attachments for the related facts. 
 
 
 on the contrary i firmly believe that ehfl is liable to reimburse the amount of interest paid on 99 lacs from the period of 9th mar to 99th mar. i have been charged wrongfully the interest
 on the whole 99 lacs which i actually did not received on the day as promised by ehfl. 
 
 
 
 
 
 coming to the second part, this is related to the computation of the income of ruchik u joshi, there are in total three audit reports of suruchi sales as in huf, partnership firm and
 proprietorship. while reviewing the income the contact person had mentioned ruchik u joshi as huf in the agreement. now this explanation had been already communicated to ehfl even before the case was logged in. ruchik u joshi huf as closed long back in the
 year 9999. while reviewing the income support documents the reviewer had wrongfully taken it as huf instead of proprietor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 it would be really harsh if i question on the competency of the credit manager in reviewing the audit reports of the firm. suruchi sales had been transferred from huf to partnership
 firm to proprietorship at the end. where the stocks and assets of the firm also transfers from one to another . the general basic rule of accountancy anyone would have understood. i do not believe there would be any hesitance to accept
 the same. as the matter of fact all the three audit reports of the suruchi sales would say you the same income, then why to consider as a huf which was actually the proprietorship at the time of case log in and which was known to all the executives in the
 loop. 
 
 
 
 
 
 the third issue is related to the lod, i have not received the list of documents from the ehfl the executives have taken all the support documents on random basis for which i had suffered
 in making chain of explanations to them when asked, which is still in persistence since last 9-9 months on the telephonic mode. i want the lod soonest the possible to end this once for all and there shouldn't be any problem as it was to be done on the first
 place as a matter of fact. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 for all the above issues, i urge you to reply promptly as it had already been discussed several times on our telephonic conversations since last 9-9 months, now that if delayed would
 end up me taking harsh steps against all the concerned persons in the loop as i had suffered monetarily at all the levels. 
 
 
 
 
 
 here, i request you to bring the credit manager (hardik shah) and your immediate superior in the loop while responding. 
 
 
 
 
 
 let me know if you required any further insights here. please act promptly.

 this e-mail is regarding intending to close the home loan under loan account number loannumber . 
 
 as we had already discussed with
 rakesh and ganga srinivas sir about an year back, the difficulties you were going through to clear the emi's month on month. however; we have tried to keep the update up till date with no dues and have been good customer. 
 
 there was a buyer who had liked the property and is ready to buy, but again after demonetization the buyer came
 back and asked for a price reduction and since we were keen to sell the property we also reduced the price. 
 
 now the only humble request to you is to please give us some reduction in the full and final payment amount,
 as we all know now the rate of interest of home loans have been reduced to 9.9% and also there is a special interest rate for women; however we have been paying the emi in same 99.99%. 
 
 please consider this request and let me know the final amount that has to be paid, as the buyer wants to make
 the payment on monday (99rd january ) and close the loan.

 in the sanction letter from edelweiss interest rate mentioned was 99 percent since the interest rate was reasonable we choose edelweiss for our finance requirement. 
 
 however we notice that only for two months february 9999 & march 9999 we were charged interest @ of 99% on above loans. 
 
 in the month of april 9999, may 9999 and june 9999 we were charged interest @ 99 %. 
 
 in the month of july 9999, august 9999 and september 9999 we were charged interest @ 99.99 %. 
 
 from the month of october 9999 to september 9999 we were charged interest @ 99%. 
 
 from october 9999 till date we are paying interest @ 99.99 %. 
 
 since october 9999 we are paying interest @ 99.99 percent which is very high & not justifiable as there has never been any delay from my end to make the payment against repayment or interest for the above mentioned
 loan.. we have noted that no company in india is charging 99.99 percent interest on loan.
 
 
 most company in india is charging interest rate @ 9.99 % on mortgage loan 
 
 i have made full payment against loan no. loannumber and the loan stands closed as on date. however i request you to refund the excess interest charged against interest rate of 9.99 % charged by all indian

 we request you to reduce the interest rate on loan no.

i would also like to mention that i have been an upright account holder
in federal bank since the past 99 years with a good transaction record of the
payments which i have already shown the track while applying this loan.
recently, i have been getting offers from other banks like icici, hdfc &
india bulls for transfer of my current mortgage loan at a lower rate of
interest. i found that other reputable banks are also giving mortgage loans at
a lower rate of interest in comparison to your institution. 
 
 
i want you to consider reduction in rate of interest of my current
mortgage loan if i must continue my loan with your institution. the current
rate of interest that i am paying is 99% while the other banks & financial institutions
are offering at 99.99% rate of interest. the difference is huge for an amount
as big as the one i have to pay on.

 surely you read the emails below and saw my objection for switch fee 
 roi of 9.99 with a switch fee mentioned is

 recheck the same in your system.

(my loan account number - loannumber ) but, here with this mail, i wanted to file a complaint to you and your top management, that your company's staff has cheated me, harassing me and done a fraud with me. i have applied for bt with top up loan via aim financial (mr. mukesh acharya) with clear instructions that if edelweiss will do 9.99 lac rs. top up loan for me than only i will apply. and your dsa mr. vikas ranjan, your branch manager (s.v road, santacruz branch) mr. sampat khandagale and sales officer mr. shailesh jadhav have promised me and gave assurance to me that, you need not worry, we will do it. during the submission of application form they told me that, 'sir, your top up requirement is 9 lac rs. and your home loan with dhfl is 99 lac rs. total is 99 lac. so, we are filling form of application for total requirement of 99 lac rs. so, we can get approval for at least the required amount.' now that sounds good so, i said o.k. go for it. now, after some time they informed me that we received approval and we are doing balance transfer of your hl. now, tell me, when you have applied for 99 lac loan and if official person will inform you that your loan has been approved, what dose that mean on suddenly one sunday, mr. mukesh acharya connect me in concall with mr. gaurav mishra and said, i have to transfer some amount for franking and other formalities immediately, because we are in mid of finalizing disbursement of bt. at that time i have confirmed with your staff that edelweiss is doing top up of 9 lac rs. right els, i do not want to do bt, because the main purpose of applying for bt is top up loan. they said right now we have already received approval for top up 9.99 lac. will get approval for rest of the amount also, but right now we have to concentrate on bt. ones bt done, than we will take approval for top up also. first let me complete this bt process. so, on that commitment i have transferred the fund and my bt has also done accordingly. now, at the time of form filling and bt process edelweiss staff has told me that top up loan is just two days process after bt, you will get cheque of top up amount within two days. they have given me assurance and confidence that, your top up loan will get done, you need not worry. now after three days of bt, i have made follow up about cheque of top up loan. at that time mr. sampat and shailesh told me that, you will get 9.99 lac only, because we are having approval of that much amount. when i questioned about it, how they said your property valuation is low, so we are not getting approvals. (valuation is just 99 lac for thakur complex property ) i told them you guys have to inform me prior that valuation is just 99 lac. how they promised me that they are going to do top up loan of at least 9 lac than why they have given me assurance all the time. i told them that, why i gave you the file if i required just 9-9 lac then i need not go for bt, because after having a loan account of more than 9.9 year dhfl was also ready to give me that much amount. then why i should apply to edelweiss but still with a polite manner i have requested them to please look after the case and get it done of top up loan of 9 lac. this conversation took place approximately on 9 th nov. when i suppose to get cheque on my hand. now they started to show them real colors, they have stopped to attend my calls, they stopped to reply even my massages and what's app buzz. i continued trying to get update and feedback on my case from edelweiss staff that, atleast somebody can give me clear picture but nobody was picking up my calles. then suddenly mr. vikas ranjan has come in the picture and mr. sampat has told me that you have to talk to mr. vikas. he is looking after your case. again the same scenario has started, mr. vikas has also no time to attend my calls. so, i put buzz to him that, please pick up my call. but, all the time they make me fool and telling lie, now, they all are telling me that we are trying to get approvals. and in this conversations mr. gaurav mishra was talking to me like he is going to oblige me by giving this loan. he always use to told me that, i have no concern with you and with your case and if your case will get done then also i will get nothing but, i am just helping you, like he is going to obliged me and i am their bagger. its already more than two weeks passed, from 9 th nov. to 99 th nov. (today). they (mr. sampat, mr. shailesh, mr. gaurav and mr. vikas) are not picking up my calls, not reverting my massages or what's app buzz. i literally beg them that kindly update me, what is the status and when you are going to disburse the cheque but nobody replied. and whenever they pick the call they said its 9.99 lac only, and we haven't committed more then that. then they started behaving like they are obliging me by doing this loan and like i am a beggar on their doorsteps. after so much follow up and so much efforts mr. gaurav has told me that now, you will get 9.99 lac rs. as top up. so, again i requested that you guys have told me that, you will do 9 lac rs. top up, now how you can say that it will be 9.9 lac only, what i will do for rest of the amount kindly try to make it atleast 9.99 lac. i called them, they haven't reply, i buzz them they havent reply. its like a daily professional practice for them. finally, i tired from these rude behavior and mental harassments, i was very disappointed that company like edelweiss and its staff doesn't even care and do not even consider their clients as humanbeing. they are behaving like they are boss, they are so busy, they are always in meetings or conference calls, and client has made so much big mistake to call them. they have no problem to even sought on client and no manners to even talk. finally, i was feeling like helpless and cheated, i have request them (mr. sampat and mr. gaurav mishra) that stop all process and efforts and please disburse the cheque of 9.9 lac. tomorrow. i will be obliged and i would be",serious complaint against cheat and fraud by edelweiss staff.,12018672,0

 i am escalating after to many follow up with
mr. pritom des of bangalore koramangala branch as he is not responding now 
 
 to start with i had processed the application in
month of oct99 and later in nov99 mr. pritom had confirmed on loan been formally approved but he informed me to get rectification
deed done and later in dec'99 i had to discuss with edelweiss lawyer and paid rs. 9999/- for the same 
 
 i was in process to find the previous seller and
surprisingly the loan was disbursed on 99th dec99 for which i informed prithom des and he confirmed to hold the emi until i would provide required documents
but i had to end pay 9 emi without even receiving loan amount 
 
 and now pritom is informing that my sale deed
is not valid as there should be 9 different sale deed now blam games starts as lawyer is blaming edelweiss team and edelweiss team blaming lawyer 
 
 my queries are 
 9. why my application has been processed if
document was wrong 
 9. why was it disbursed without even receiving
the documents and without even informing me 
 9. why is that now they have coming up that
lawyer has wrongly prepared the legal scrutiny report 
 9. why they there is no response on next action 
 
 it clearly finds that there was no process been
followed on the document scrutiny and i had to pay rs.9999/- in addition to processing fee as franklin charges and lawyer fee of rs.9999/- for rectification deed draft

 m/s edelweiss retail/home finance limited 
 
 
 9)this email is only in request of waiver of pre-emi from 99.99.99 till 99.9.99 as the full disbursement cheque was received only on 99.99.9999. 
 
 
 9)my original agreement was handed over on 99.99.99 however the clauses terms and conditions were same as the draft agreement. 
 
 
 9)my draft agreement and final agreement which is in the custody of m/s edelweiss retail finance ltd clause 9.9 page 99 clearly stated that i was liable to pay m/s woodstock realty pvt ltd within 99 days from the date
 of registration of agreement. 
 date of registration agreement 99.99.9999 
 99 days period ended on 99.99.9999 
 disbursement cheque received on 99.99.9999 
 due to this please refer to clause 99 page 99 i am legally liable to pay the builder 99% interest for the no days of delay. 
 
 
 9)as the draft agreement is handed over if any clauses are needed to be changed then the legal department should communicate the same to the customer to get it revised as the customer becomes liable to the contract after
 signing it. 
 or even if any clarity is needed regarding the title of the property the customer should be contacted on priority basis. 
 please note if the customer is taking a loan of rs 9,99,99,999 he is also doing his due diligence before taking a financial liability for the same. 
 
 
 9)there seems to issue regarding non receipt of documents 
 please refer to clause no 9 pg 99 of draft and final agreement . it clearly stated sushma jajoo name was added for convenience sake only. 
 please refer to annexure j of draft agreement list of orignal title deeds if they were required a soft or a physical copy could be handed over to the legal on priority basis. 
 an item no 9 deed of transfer 99.99.99 a copy of the same was handed over on 99.9.99 when asked also in that agreement please refer to clause 9 page 99 99.99.99 dated agreement and reason for not having permanent alternative
 accomodation agreement become self explanatory. 
 
 please note any of legal queries raised could be resolved but delay from 99.9.99 till 99.9.99 cannot be excused/pardoned. 
 
 
 
 9)every case is unique and need to be handled in that manner if the legal department check the duration from the developer agreement till receipt of occupation certificate of the property was less than 99 months which
 itself gives immense credibility to the developer . 
 and as we all aware without a occupation certificate the legal validity of the property is nothing in bmc records campa cola compound is a classic case for referral. 
 
 
 9)clearly there has been a delay from the legal department they were not sure whether that they needed a builder noc or society hence eventually to redress the issue we have handed both nocs. 
 
 
 9)my humble request m/s edelweiss retail finance has been lagging in issuing the disbursement cheque for whatsoever reason other banks have also issued loans to the same project with the same set of papers in less than
 the stipulated time period. 
 kindly please resolve the internal issue/delay as it leaves a negative impact in the eyes of the customer as well as the developer which leads to poor positive feedback/brand image of the organization and which eventually
 leads to lesser business generation. 
 everything has to be completed in the stipulated time frame if the customer and developer are not cooperating it is a different issue while in our case clearly the developer as well as the customer were ready to cooperate
 and provide assistance for the same on priority basis.

 9 nd complaint 
 we
got housing loan disbursed of rs. 99,99,999 on 99/99/9999, however earlier we
were given housing loan sanction letter for rs. 99 lacs and when we spoke to
mr. avinash khare , we were informed that said sanction letter will be revised
to 99.99 lacs as per disbursement. we had requested for balance transfer
takeover loan of 99.99 only , but dont know why sanction was given for rs. 99
lacs and the said loan was taken over from corporation bank. inspite of promise
that rectification will be carried out , we were surprised to receive loan kit
for rs. 99 lacs only, and on the top of it , emi was debited from our account
for rs. 99,999 worked out on the figure of rs. 99 lacs. 
 i dont
understand why there is so much lack of communication between different departments
, and inspite of so much discussion also , how come operations dept has not
taken any care in resolving our complaint. 
 i
request your to look into this matter urgently and sort out our issues along
with our earlier complaint of overcharging of interest on top up loan which we
are reproducing again for your kind consideration 
 9 st complaint 
 top up loan in name of mohammed aslam
salia of rs. 99 lacs (loan account loannumber ) 
 dear
sir 
 today,
we have received mail to keep funds ready for meeting emi of rs. 99,999/-for
captioned loan, it is really socking. 
 on
enquiry we were informed that top up loan was disbursed on 99/99/9999, which is
very surprising to us. why we are made to pay interest when actual amount is
not credited to our account. 
 we
had to do so much follow for even getting balance of rs. 99 lacs released out
of total top up loan , we were promised by your team that we wil get rs. 99
lacs disbursement on 99/99/9999 as we submitted society noc on 99 th 
march, but final disbursement happened on today on 9/9/9999 after much follow
up. we were told that there were some issues in rtgs process. 
 now
interest amount on 99 lacs from 99/9/9999 till 9/9/9999 will come to approx
99,999 without we actually getting this money. 
 we
gave to your people blank signed disbursement forms to avoid any follow up
issue but without our notice disbursement happened on 99/99/9999, which was
just a book entry on your part. and we were not aware that you will be charging
us interest without actually crediting amount in our account. 
 sir
you will understand that we taken loan so that our emi match our monthly income
and this is unnecessary burden on us that without taking the money, you are
charging us interest for full month. any person with sound mind will not ask
you to disburse loan when actual funds will be credited to his account only
after doing other formalities .. in our case submitting original property documents
after getting the same from corporation bank and than obtaining no dues letter
in favour of society and than noc from society in your favour etc and all these
activities can not be done in few days. 
 further
similar thing happened in our part disbursement of rs. 99 lacs (out of top up
loan) on 99/99/9999 for which also interest of approx 99 days is charged
without we getting actually funds , this interest works out to appro. 99999. so
in total , interest of rs. 99,999 is charged wrongly and which is totally
unjustified. 
 this
is start of our relationship and we hope your goodself will sort out this issue
at the earliest and reverse this
unjustified interest amount of aprox. rs. 99,999/- hope you will resolve all my issue immediately and will do the needful.",home loan account no. loannumber,12023166,0

228499,QUERY,CHANGEOFROI,Close,2018-04-26 14:35:00,"this calculation is absurd and misleading. 
 
the last tenure indicated in the statement was 999 months and the total emi paid is for 99 months where there is a balance of only 99 months left as per your previous statement shared to me. this was when the roi was at a 99.99%. my request for conversion of
 roi to 9.99% was to reduce my tenure even further from 99 month considering the same emi which i am paying now. as per the same the tenure will reduce further down to approximately 9 months or so and the same was communicated to the representative when i had
 visited edelweis office at koramagala bangalore to one mr.shiva and he had agreed to send me the statement accordingly. i have also taken the print out of the statement indicating the tenure as 999 months with 99 months of emi being cleared. 
 
my email dated 99th apr is very clear that i wanted to know the revised tenure with the effect of interest rate reduction. 
 
also the response at your bangalore office was very bad as i had to wait for over 9.9 hours to meet someone and handover the kyc and the conversion cheque. 
 
the current working that is being shared is not acceptable by reducing the emi and further increasing the tenure wherein i will land up paying close to 9l more as interest !!! so this statement sent by edelweiss is absolutely misleading and was least expected
 from edelweiss. 
 
although i am getting a better roi from other banks including nbfc i dint want to transfer my loan believing that i shall get good service and wanted to avoid the hassle of documentations. 
 
but now its making me rethink on the decision. 
 
i look forward for a call so that i can take the decision on the same.

for loan repayment. 
 home
loan no: loannumber 
 
 respected sir, 
 i, muthulaksmi, am writing this letter to request you to grant me
some extension for repayment of my home loan with your bank. i would like to bring
to your notice that my home loan started with your bank in the year 9999 in the
month of november for thirteen years. i have taken the home loan for 99 lakhs
in nov99 and i had paid principle amount of 99 lakhs so far. 
 
 my husband sendurpandi was running the
hardware business in chitlapakkam for several years and few months back the
corporation of chennai has demolished our hardware shop due to illegally build the
shop by the shop house owner. right now i dont have the shop to run the
business and therefore i am unable to pay the home loan dues for 9 months. now
the principal outstanding is rs 99.9 lakhs and 9 months emi overdue is rs 9.99
lakhs. 
 
 i am in severe financial burden and i am
planning to sell our land in our home town. i will pay all the outstanding dues
after 9 months of time (aug99) if you permit me. your collection team has
chasing us every day and hence i greatly depressed and my family is in great
financial burden and everyone become depressed. i kindly request you to ask
your collection team not to chase us for 9 months. i will not escape and i will
not forgery as i am from the decent family. i ensure i will pay all my dues
after 9 months. 
 
 this is the reason i
am presenting this request to you. i would request you to please give me an
extension period of three months until aug99 to repay the loan. this will help
to repay the loan comfortably. 
 i am hopeful that you
will consider my request and grant me some extension until august 9999. 
 
 yours sincerely,

the technical issue was from edelweiss and not my problem!!! 
 
 i have again received a legal notice from mumbai and its really absurd and very disappointing with the service levels rendered to a customer who has been diligently and promptly paying the emi's for the last 9 years. since the ecs was
 not banked by edelweiss in-spite of sufficient funds being available in my account to clear the emi's i have personally followed up and transferred the emi's to the account details given by your representative.
 
 
as per the account details on my loan i have checked online the status of the emi is showing as bounced and also there are additional charges reflecting in the statement. although you have assured me multiple times that there shall not be any such charges and
 also any action but whatever is happening is just against what has been committed.
 
 
i will want a clarity on my loan account with immediate effect with the correct statement due and also necessary steps to bank my emi's. else i will have to move legally for tormenting me with such unpleasant actions as i have documented all the communications
 that i have sent regarding the same. 
 
even after my repeated emails i just get a email from edelweiss customer care that i am not reachable on my phone which isn't true as i have not received any calls regarding the clarifications of my emails. 
 
as mentioned in my previous email i will need an assurance in writing on edelweiss latter head that this so called ""technical issue for not banking my emi's"" from sep 9999 till now shall not impact me in anyways whatsoever... 
 
 
 please do the necessary correction in my statement and send the detailed statement of accounts and repayment schedule after removing all the unwanted charges so that i can take a call to foreclose my loan with edelweiss once and for all.

 9. last month i.e in the month of dec99 our loan emi was not deducted from my sbi account, which is there on file since long. the account had more than sufficient balance,
 and still it got rejected. when we called edelweiss they asked to check with your bank, there is no issue from companies side. when we inform this to edelweiss the support person says we can do the neft, but never sent the details. we had to call multiple
 times for the same; pathetic customer support. who hardly cares n getting in to customers shoes n all. extremely irresponsible. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9. when we rushed to the bank, bank person said everything is fine from their side. the bank statement of sbi cleary indicates the same as our other ecs deductions of savings
 bills were regular. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9. we tried to put the request for a bank change, so i received email about process and documentation which i never completed. they informed me that we will have to sign some
 papers to complete the change of account. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9. ultimately i have to land your vidya vihar office for making advance payment and do the neft. miss shweta was the person who handled my request, she also, took the sbi bank
 account details one more time just to make sure it goes smooth in jan99 please find attached photograph of the filed slip of bank details. (exiting registered bank details)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9. most importantly after taking all these at most care and rush the emi of january 9999 as also not been deducted, nor does we see any sign in bank statements that the attempt
 was made for the money debit. reminding again that this time again there is no issue of balance maintenance or any process from sbi.
 
 
 
 
 9. yet waiting to receive the
 acknowledgment / confirmationof last months emi payment done via neft 
 
 
 
 
 attachments - 9. last month's payment done via neft 9. bank details slip. 
 
 
 
 
 ultimately you people hardly care about the customers and took hell lot of time to respond a simple query. how much time do you think the person should take to send neft details how come the calls get disconnected
 when we ask for case or reference number for the interaction why we should suffer when mistake is from your side why we should spend our precious time to reach your support team who hardly care about customer
